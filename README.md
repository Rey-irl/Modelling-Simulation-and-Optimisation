This project aims to get an optimal delivery center in each township, creating a model of the business according to entities, events, variables parameters and activities for getting a process, which ones are simulated by Iterative Integer 
Programming or heuristics algorithms according to their significance. 

Keywordsâ€”Modelling, customers, parcels, delivery center, driver, locations, simulation, Integer Programming, Heuristic solution, ANOVA.
