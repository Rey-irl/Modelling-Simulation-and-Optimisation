# Modelling-Simulation-and-Optimisation
The aim of this project is to get an optimal delivery centre in  each township, creating a model of the business according to  entities, events, variables and parameters and activities for  getting a process, which ones are simulated by Iterative Integer  Programming or heuristics algorithm according to the  significance of them.
